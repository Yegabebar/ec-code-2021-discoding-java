**JQuery v3.6.0**

jQuery is a small, light-weight and fast JavaScript library. The userbase is huge and the project is maintained by 250+ people.
It's distributed in MIT license so Discoding can edit it to suit its needs without copyrights issues.

I've decided to add it to the project because of the following benefits:
- It's a small, fast and lightweight JavaScript library.
- It's platform-independent.
- It simplifies AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.
- It has 1M+ topics on stack overflow

Note: I've chosen the minified version for the sake of performance. It's a lighter version than the regular one (because of its compressed format) for faster loading times in client web browsers.
